COVOICE-19 is a research project focused on exploring how Artificial Intelligence can help us in providing an early diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as in supporting medical professionals in the prognosis of the coronavirus disease 2019. Ultimately, the goal is to mitigate the spread of the disease through rapid screening, while providing predicitve decision-support for improved hospital resource management and prognosis.

The project has been funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology in the context of the AI 4 COVID-19 call. It is led by UNINOVA - Centre of Technology and Systems, with the participation of the Ocidental Lisbon Hospital Center (CHLO), which includes the departments of infectiology and otorhinolaryngology from the Egas Moniz Hospital.
